[space-location-description]
cronus=Cronus is a massive gas giant, with swirling bands of colorful clouds in shades of red and maroon, banded by white. Its atmosphere is a turbulent mix of hydrogen, helium, and ammonia, constantly in motion with powerful storms. Dozens of moons orbit the giant, most notably, desolate Selene, icy Aquilo, methane-blanketed Aiolos, and life-laden Feronia. The gas giant radiates immense heat and magnetism, and its powerful gravity dominates the surrounding region.
selene=Selene is a desolate, airless moon devoid of life and littered with craters and ice. Ancient volcanic activity and impacts have left the surface scarred, yet rich in Aluminum and Titanium. A minimal atmosphere is maintained by cryogeysers of Chlorine.
